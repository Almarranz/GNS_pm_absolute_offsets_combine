# GNS_pm_absolute_offsets_combine
Alignment with Gaia using lists of combained chips in order to get more GaiaÂ´ stars

0. gns1_B_lists.py. Combines GNS1 H and d ks lists. IN this version we do not
cutout the overlapping fields. The idea is to use more Gaia stars for the 
GNS2 fiel and see if that improves the alignemnt

1. gaia_refstars_offsets_gns_pixels.py. Give Gaia offsets cordinates and move
then to the corresponding epoch. Then uses astroaling to alingn the *gns xy 
coordenates* with the Gaia offsets.
>NOTE1:We use foregroud stars in GNS1 for m
>matching Gaia stars and use the matching stars in astroalign. If we use 
>astroalign directly with the whole lists (fore and background), aa cant find
>the transformation. The same thing we have to do with GNS2, but, since GNS2 
>only has H band, we have to match with GNS1 for foreground, so we are limited
>to the Gaia star overlapping with GNS1. Once aa has found the tranformation
>for GNS2 we aplay it to the whole GNS2 lists.

2. IDL_gaia_offset_gns_xy_align.pro Align GNS to Gaia with a polinomal of degree
1 or 2

3. IDL_GaiaRf_align_gns_offsets.pro Find matching stars and substract for pm.

# 2.2 (A). bs_uncert_offsets.py. Give the ra and dec bs uncertainties for each star

# 3. IDL_GaiaRf_align_gns_offsets.pro Find matching stars and substract for pm.
# Also incorporates the aignemnet errors to the pm ones.

# 3.1 gaia_stars_offsets_comp.py. Computes residuals with Gaia catalog. The point
# is to get rid of the 3sigma stars and repit the alignment without then.
